## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course *4.619 Historiography of Islamic Architecture* as it was taught by Professor Nasser Rabbat in Fall 2014.

This seminar presented a critical review of literature on Islamic architecture in the last two centuries and analyzed its historical and theoretical frameworks. It challenged the tacit assumptions and biases of standard studies of Islamic architecture and addressed historiographic and critical questions concerning how knowledge of a field is defined, produced, and reproduced.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

This course included weekly reading and writing assignments and required active participation in discussions. The course aimed at providing the student with a general overview of the literature on Islamic architecture and helped him/her in learning how to read texts critically. Another goal for this course was to help students deduce arguments from thick and dense descriptions.

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

Many students will continue to take more historiographic courses after completing this one. Most students who took this course were [SMArchS](http://architecture.mit.edu/computation/degree/smarchs) or PhD students focusing on the history, theory, and criticism of architecture. These students were usually preparing for a career in academe.
